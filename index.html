                                                Vincent ‘Biofrost’ Wang is the starting Support for TSM’s
                                                main League of Legends roster going into 2020. A familiar name to many
                                                of our fans - Biofrost was introduced to the LCS in Summer of 2016,
                                                playing his rookie split on TSM during which the team finished top of
                                                the league with a 17-1 record and steamrolled the competition during
                                                playoffs. Following that split, he stayed on the team for an additional
                                                year, never losing a single best of 5 series and winning two more
                                                playoffs with the organization. Biofrost is returning to TSM for season
                                                10 after spending the past two years on CLG, during which his leadership
                                                skills developed greatly. Along with his ability to cleanly execute
                                                plays with high mechanical requirements in clutch moments, Biofrost’s
                                                return is an exciting moment for all parties involved.

                                                for himself in that scene. He started his career in PUBG in mid-2017
                                                where he played in online leagues like PUBGonline and Auzom and was
                                                signed to the Pittsburgh Knights soon after. He describes himself as a
                                                confident and decisive player, preferring to make plays that allow his
                                                team to succeed.

                                                competitive squad at the end of June 2019. He is a veteran FPS player,
                                                notably achieving top 500 in Overwatch (with a peak of Rank 7) in every
                                                season he played. Despite this, he chose to keep a low-profile, only
                                                choosing to go pro with Apex Legends which he has been playing since its
                                                release. He got into the competitive scene barely a month after, during

                                                represent the organization in Apex Legends. He is a new face to
                                                Twitch.tv, having been streaming for only 5 months at the time of his
                                                signing. He began as a Ring of Elysium player, where he managed to
                                                achieve a number of world records for kills. He has since swapped to
                                                Apex Legends, where his aggressive playstyle has resulted in #1
                                                positions in kills and damage done on the leaderboards. His favorite

                                                creator/competitor at the start of September 2019. Tanner was originally
                                                a Competitive 1v1 Call of Duty player for 4-5 years before moving onto
                                                Battle Royale games, where he managed to get first on the FPP
                                                leaderboards in PUBG before moving onto CoD Blackout. He swapped
                                                immediately to Apex Legends upon its release, falling in love with its
                                                unique gameplay and has spent his time playing it ever since. Despite
                                                being primarily a content creator, Tanner and his team were able to take
                                                2nd place in a Twitch Rivals tournament against competitive teams such
                                                as 100T and C9. Tanner takes pride in his goofy and positive attitude on
                                                stream, doing his best to greet every single person and create a unique

                        William ‘Leffen’ Hjelte was signed by the TSM organization near the beginning of 2015. He is
                        commonly known as the Villain of the Smash community for his outspoken opinions and strong
                        personality. Despite this, he is well respected as one of the most proficient Fox mains in the
                        world, with some of the best technical skills and having one of the strongest neutral games in
                        the Smash Bros Melee scene. In the course of his career, Leffen has ascended from his title as
                        "Godslayer", with many considering him to be on a similar level to the remaining Gods of Smash
                        Brothers Melee. Recently, he can be found playing Dragonball: Fighter Z as a side game, where he
                        is also considered a top player.
